(* So there's a bug in Unix.select on Windows. Basically, select is supposed to be
 * "level triggered". That is, as long as you select a ready fd, select should always return it.
 * This is opposed to an "edge triggered" API  which would only return the fd when it becomes
 * available.
 *
 * However, Unix.select doesn't seem to behave this way on Windows. If you call Unix.select with
 * only sockets, then it uses the select system call  and everything is fine. But if you call
 * Unix.select with a mix of fd types (like stdin and a socket, or a pipe and a socket), it
 * falls back to some other code.
 *
 * The long and the short of it is that sometimes a ready fd isn't returned by Unix.select on
 * Windows when you pass in a mix of sockets and non-sockets. The work around is to split the
 * single Unix.select call into multiple Unix.select calls.

(*
 * So there's a bug in Unix.select on unix (Linux and OSX). Basically, select is supposed to raise
 * EBADF on bad fds, but it raises EINVAL on fds that are < 0 or >= FD_SETSIZE. Lwt can handle EBADF
 * and will filter out bad fds. However, it doesn't handle EINVAL.
 *
 * So until this is fixed, let's just translate EINVAL to EBADF. This is only dangerous if EINVAL
 * is ever thrown for something other than a bad fd. From the man page, EINVAL is only thrown for
 *
 * 1) invalid timeouts (impossible from the OCaml API)
 * 2) nfds is < 0 or > RLIMIT_NOFILE, which also should be impossible due the c code in select.c
 *
 * So the only case we really need to worry about is fds that are larger than FD_SETSIZE but still
 * valid. From select's manpage:
 *
 * "select() can monitor only file descriptors numbers that are less than FD_SETSIZE;
 *  poll(2) does not have this limitation"
 *
 * So we're kind of screwed if we have large fds we need to monitor anyway.
